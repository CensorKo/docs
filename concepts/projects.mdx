Projects help you organize memories into logical groups. Think of them as namespaces or containers for related memories.

## Why Use Projects?

- **Separation** - Keep different applications' memories separate
- **Organization** - Group memories by user, client, or use case
- **Filtering** - Search within a specific project
- **Permissions** - Future: share specific projects with team members

## Default Project

Every user has a `default` project that's used when no project is specified:

```json
{
  "id": "proj_default",
  "name": "default",
  "description": "Default project"
}
```

## Creating Projects

Create projects via API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://t0ken.ai/api/v1/projects \
  -H "X-API-Key: omx_your_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "name": "customer-support-bot",
    "description": "Memories for the support chatbot"
  }'
```

## Project Naming

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Keep names descriptive but concise
- Use consistent naming conventions

Good examples:
- `myapp-production`
- `customer-support`
- `user-12345`

## Using Projects

Specify the project when creating memories:

```bash
curl -X POST https://t0ken.ai/api/v1/memories \
  -H "X-API-Key: omx_your_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "content": "User asked about pricing",
    "project_id": "customer-support-bot"
  }'
```

Filter by project when searching:

```bash
curl -X POST https://t0ken.ai/api/v1/memories/search \
  -H "X-API-Key: omx_your_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "query": "pricing questions",
    "project_id": "customer-support-bot"
  }'
```
