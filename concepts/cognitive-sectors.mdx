title: Cognitive Sectors
description: 'Understanding AI memory classification'

OpenMemoryX automatically classifies memories into five cognitive sectors, inspired by human memory systems. This classification happens automatically using AI.

## The Five Sectors

### Episodic Memory

Events and experiences tied to specific times and contexts.

  **Examples:**
  - "User visited Paris in summer 2024"
  - "User completed onboarding yesterday"
  - "User had a meeting with the sales team"
</Card>

### Semantic Memory

Facts, concepts, and general knowledge.

  **Examples:**
  - "User prefers dark mode in all apps"
  - "User works as a software engineer"
  - "User's company is based in Tokyo"
</Card>

### Procedural Memory

Skills, processes, and how-to knowledge.

  **Examples:**
  - "User knows how to deploy Docker containers"
  - "User is proficient in Python"
  - "User follows a specific code review process"
</Card>

### Emotional Memory

Feelings, preferences, and emotional responses.

  **Examples:**
  - "User feels frustrated with complex UIs"
  - "User enjoys sci-fi movies"
  - "User is excited about AI technology"
</Card>

### Reflective Memory

Insights, summaries, and self-knowledge.

  **Examples:**
  - "User values privacy over convenience"
  - "User prefers async communication"
  - "User's goal is to learn machine learning"
</Card>

## How Classification Works

When you create a memory:

1. **Submit** - Send content to API
2. **AI Analysis** - GPT-4 analyzes the content
3. **Sector Assignment** - Determines the most appropriate sector
4. **Importance Scoring** - Calculates relevance (0-1)
5. **Storage** - Saves with classification metadata

## Using Sectors

### Filter by Sector

```bash
curl "https://t0ken.ai/api/v1/memories?sector=semantic" \
  -H "X-API-Key: omx_your_api_key"
```

### Search with Sector Context

The search API automatically considers cognitive sectors when ranking results, giving you more relevant matches based on the type of information you're looking for.

## Benefits

- **Better Search** - Sector context improves relevance
- **Memory Organization** - Natural categorization
- **Insights** - Understand what types of information you store most
- **Filtering** - Focus on specific memory types
